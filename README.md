# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school destrict analysis
The purpose of this practice was to find the average passing scores for students in each district and explore if there is a trend. The Challenge was to see the impact of a mistake in one school. 

## Results
The mistake in THS had impact on the summary of the data related to that specific school
### How is the district summary affected?
- no effect on the district summary as the school was in Charter type category
### How is the school summary affected?
 - the overal passing score precentages was changes by 0.1%. The change was more obsrvable in the percentage of math scores.
### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- THS was second best school, considering the ninth grade scores. Now that we removed that value due to mistaken entry, they came down to 4th place from top schools
### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
#### Math and reading scores by grade
Obviously it had an effect on the ninth grade values but not on the rest of the grades
#### Scores by school spending
THS was in the $630-644 category of school spending and hence that group was affected by the changes in this grade
#### Scores by school size
THS is considered as Medium size school and hence changes in the scores affected the average on the Medium size schools
#### Scores by school type
The changes only affected the Charter type schools as THS was a part of that type of schools

## Summary 
The impact of removing the error numbers from one school was so small. In the events where there is an error in the data that can't be fixed, removing the trouble part is a good solution that does not have a large impact on the overal analysis.
